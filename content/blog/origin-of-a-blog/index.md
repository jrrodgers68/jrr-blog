So this is the first post for my new blog.  I suppose I should begin 
with a little about myself.  I've been working in tech my entire career, 
going on 30 years soon.  Wow - how did that happen to me?  How have I been
out of college for nearly 30 years?!?   Where did the time go?  Well, hopefully,
I've learned something along the way and I'll be able to share my continued
learnings with the world at large.  I currently work in NYC for a large fin-tech 
company in the city.  I've been there for just over 14 years.    

This blog will primarily document the various projects I work on in my spare
time.  My main interests revolve around home automation, iot systems, and a 
little bit of hacking.  I'm always looking for new ways to expand my skills
and typically search for new technologies to apply to the projects that I 
develop.
