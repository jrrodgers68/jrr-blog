Well, its been just over 2 months since my last post. Way too long between posts, but I've been busy (isn't that always the excuse?) I've been taking classes at night after work - mostly on Udemy - to try to beef up my Javascript skills and React knowledge. I felt like I needed to learn a lot more before I messed with the Gatsby page generator. After several different React classes, I finally feel like I have a good grasp of React and modern Javascript.

So, the classes I've taken that I feel are worth-while are the following:

## Modern React with Redux [2020 Update][udemy link](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/)

This class by Stephen Grider is really the best React class I have taken. I took 1 or 2 courses before this one and thought I knew something about React, but those courses focused on class based components and didn't mention anything about hooks. I was watching a Twitch stream where the presenter was developing a React app using hooks and I felt completely lost. Even the Javascript syntax he was using left me confused. That was what sent me searching for another class about React that would include material on hooks. The course has over 47 hours of material so it takes quite a time investment to get through it. The hooks material is less than 2 hours of that, but with all the other content, I felt it worked out fine. You build something like 9 different apps during the class and they are pretty varied so I didn't feel like I got bored with the same app.

## React and Serverless - Fullstack Web Development by James Q Quick

You can find the class [here](https://learn.jamesqquick.com/react-and-serverless-fullstack-web-development). It will cost you \$40 USD. I got it for half price as I was watching his stream on Twitch when he announced it. I think this was a good follow on class to the ones above, but I think if you didn't know anything about React at all it might be a little much.

## Serverless React with AWS Amplify - The Complete Guide [Udemy Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-react-with-aws-amplify/)

I started this class before the first one and felt like I needed to stop and get a better understanding of React before continuing. It took a little over 3 weeks to get through the first class and then another week or so to get through class #2 before being able to get back to this class. I am just getting back to it now and will be working on it this weekend.

So I feel like I'm ready to start working on some of the projects that I want to work on that would involve creating a web front-end for, such as my web link manager.

So, what classes are you taking? Do you have any classes/workshops/tutorials that you've taken that you would recommend? I'd like to hear about them if you have them!
