So, I just finished doing a hacking room on [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) and I think I've seen a few common threads.  Another site to try is [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu).   

## Starting Hacking Tips

1. Always check history files - you never know what interesting information can be found there.  Especially in these types of environments where they want you to find the clues they've left behind

2. If its a Linux box, always check to see if the user that you've been able to login with has sudo rights - take the quick path if its there
